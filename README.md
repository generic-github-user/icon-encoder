# icon-encoder

This project is an implementation of an autoencoder neural network (as well as my first project with TensorFlow Python). It is designed to condense images of website favicons down to a small set of latent variables and then reconstruct these variables into an approximation of the original image. Once a high-dimensional representation of the training data is learned, novel images can be generated by randomizing the latent variables. Also see [my implementation](https://github.com/generic-github-user/TensorFlow.js-VAE) of a variational autoencoder in TensorFlow.js.
